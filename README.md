## Techno Artist with Passion for Solving Problems

#### Hey there I'm Emeka Allison but you can all me Emeka
**To be honest**, I love making things easier. I take ideas from friends, collegues and families, and I try transform them to solutions. Among my many passions is seeing people grow and get better not just in skills but also in life.

## Things I love to do besides code!

  - Sing, compose music and listen to music
  - Create creative designs
  - I run a podcast
  - I also love playing with my dogs and imaginary fighting with my bros.
  - Help people who are new in coding
