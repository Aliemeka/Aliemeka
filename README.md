# Techno Artist with Passion for Solving Problems

##### Hey there I'm Emeka Allison but you can all be Emeka
**To be honest**, I love making things easier. I take ideas from friends, collegues and families, and I try transform them to solutions. Among my many passions is seeing people grow and get better not just in skills but also in life.

# Things I love to do besides code!

  - Sing, compose music and listen to music
  - Create creative designs of my friends that I use to surprise them on their birthdays
  - I run a podcast
  - I also love playing with my dogs and imaginary fighting with my bros.
  
Is it weird that I'm a tea person.

### Tech stack
So here are the tools and languages I'm comfortable with:
* [Angular] - Just to ensure I have checked all possible angles!
* [React] - Although I'm calm
* [JavaScript] - Yes! I love the chaos of dynamic programming.
* [Python] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [Flask] - Especially in severless mode
* [Django] - I can always migrate anyway
* [Node.js] - I won't want to make promises I won't keep
* [C/C++] - the streaming build system
* [C#] - Apparently I'm required to know this at work
* [Docker] - Still new at this

### Social network

Yes! I have a social life "online"
